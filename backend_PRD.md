# Backend Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for an AI-powered backend system.  The system will manage user authentication and leverage AI to process requests from the frontend.  The backend will be built using FastAPI and MongoDB, and the AI will be powered by Langchain and Langgraph.

## 2. Goals and Objectives
* Develop a robust, scalable, and secure backend system.
* Provide seamless user authentication and authorization.
* Enable AI processing of user requests from the frontend.
* Ensure efficient and cost-effective AI inference.

## 3. User Roles and Permissions
* **User**: Can register, log in, log out, and refresh tokens.
* **AI Agent**: Can process chat from the frontend, and edit markdown files based on the chat history.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### User Authentication
* Users should be able to register with a unique phone number and password.
* Users should be able to log in and log out.
* The system should issue access tokens and refresh tokens.
* The system should be able to refresh tokens.

### AI Chat
* Users should be able to send messages to AI agents and receive responses.
* The AI agents should be able to summarize chat histories and generate reflections.
* The AI agents should be able to edit markdown files based on the chat history, the editing markdown file and the original markdown file.
* The frontend will send the chat history, editing content and other related information to the backend.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
* The system should handle a large number of concurrent users.
* AI inference should be completed within a reasonable time.

### Security
* User data should be protected.
* Access tokens and refresh tokens should be securely stored and managed.

### Scalability
* The system should be able to scale to accommodate future growth.

## 6. Technical Requirements
* The backend will be built using FastAPI.
* MongoDB will be used as the database.
* Langchain and Langgraph will be used for building AI agents.

## 7. Open Issues and Risks
* The specific AI models to be used need to be finalized.
* The cost of AI inference needs to be monitored and optimized.
* The security measures for protecting user data need to be implemented.

## 8. Success Metrics
* Number of registered users.
* Average AI inference time.
* Cost per AI inference.
* User satisfaction with the AI chat experience.

## 9. Future Considerations
* Integration with other AI platforms.
* Expansion of AI capabilities (e.g., image and video processing).
* Development of a frontend interface.
